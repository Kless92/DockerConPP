    Following the Workshop at the end of this week, write a Portfolio Project report with your answers to the following questions:

    1.) What are the various features you would like your project to offer? 

    2.) What are the API endpoints that you would need to set up for each feature? 
        List them along with the respective HTTP verb, endpoint URL, and any special 
        details (query parameters, request bodies, headers). 

    3.) Provide a description of the database tables required for your application, 
        including column names, data types, constraints, and foreign keys. Include 
        your database name. You can optionally include an ER diagram.

    1.) I would add my original features before I hand to cut them out for time.
        Which includes if professor is a grad student, what building and room
        number the course would be taken and if what professor will sub if one 
        is absent.

    2.) Building will have is own folder containing ther own endpoints.
        index - Show all id and room reated to building. http://address/building
        show - Shows room base on id. http://address/building/id
        post - Create new room with id, if parameteres are meet. http://address/building
        delete - Removes slected room on id. http://address/building/id
        update - Updates room base on id, if parameters are meet. http://address/building/id
        course - Shows what room the course would be held. http://address/building/id
        update_coures - Update what coure will be place in a room, if the parameters are mett.
                        or make the room vacant. http://address/building/id

        In the professors folder, two new endpoint will be added.
        One will show the name of professors who are also grad students. http://address/professors
        The other will show professors who are available to sub if one is absent. http://address/professors
    
    3.) "Show original PPER" called spencerPPER.drawio or make few changes before making a final version to submit
